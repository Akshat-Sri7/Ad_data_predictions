# Ad_data_predictions
This is my second project on Machine Learning which makes use of Logistic Regression models by sklearn. The data set consists of fake advertisement data about some users if they clicked on the ad or not. Here, I have done some exploratory data analysis and predicted if a person is likely to click on the ad or not using datasets features.

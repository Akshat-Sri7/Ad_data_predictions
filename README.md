# Ad_data_predictions
This is my second project on Machine Learning which makes use of Logistic Regression models by sklearn. The data set consists of fake advertisement data about some users if they clicked on the ad or not. Here, I have done some exploratory data analysis and predicted if a person is likely to click on the ad or not using datasets features.
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/advertisement-click-on-ad)

**Dependencies  
*numpy  
*pandas  
*matplotlib  
*scikit-learn  

You can just run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Here is a link to [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) if you don't already have it.
# Usage 
The code is being written in Jupyter Notebook, I personally used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) distributed jupyter notebook to write the code. I recommend using the same, to get the scatter plot and line of best fit without facing any memory or other issues.
